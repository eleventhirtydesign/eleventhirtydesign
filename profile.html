<h4 class="sansintro">Paul McCormack a graphic designer, educator and artist from Northern Ireland. An award winning designer, Paul has worked across multiple media from print to screen. He is currently Course Director on the Interaction Design course at the <a href="http://interaction-design.belfastschoolofart.com/">Belfast School of Art.</a></h4> 

		<h2>Design</h2>
			<p>Paul has worked for over 25 years as a designer working across a wide range of media from print to screen, exhibition and display. His client list has included the Carbon Trust, General Council of the Bar, Ministry of Defence, Northern Ireland Water, International Fund for Ireland and the Welsh Assembly.</p>
			<p>Notable work has included the award winning Omnibus magazine. Created for the Northern Ireland Office, the magazine was sent to politicians, business leaders and decision makers around the world. Omnibus was created to show the other side of Northern Ireland (the good bits) the popular media tends to ignore. During the nine years of its production, the magazine helped create a positive profile of the Province,  bringing with it increased investment and tourism.</p>
			<p>Another point of pride has been the development of the Police Service of Northern Ireland brand. Managing the development of the brand from the old Royal Ulster Constabulary to the new Police Service covered the entire range of design services from stationery to internet and intranet sites, annual reports and other literature, advertising, exhibition, display and signage systems. The success of the project was recognised when it won a national UK communications award.</p>
			
		<h2>Education</h2>
			<p>Teaching is Paul&#8217;s other passion. He has been teaching interaction design for over eight years at the Belfast School of Art. His teaching career started on the University of Ulster&#8217;s BDes Hons Graphic Design & Illustration course before moving to BSc Hons Interactive Multimedia Design where he continues to teach. 
			
			<p>The focus is now firmly on the new <a href="http://interaction-design.belfastschoolofart.com" target="_blank">BDes Hons Interaction Design</a> course. Developed in partnership with <a href="http://monographic.org/biography" target="_blank">Chris Murphy</a> and <a href="http://tejpotter.com" target="_blank">Tim Potter,</a> the course is one of the newest of its kind and will kick off with its first intake in September 2014.</p>
			<p>His research interests lie in the creative use of code in the development of simple generative outputs and the development of digital/physical artifacts.</p>
			
		<h2>Art</h2>
			<p>Moving to teaching has rekindled a number of personal projects Paul had left behind a (very) long time ago. Acting as a creative release from client driven design work his art practice is developing in a number of ways.</p>
			<p>One route has taken him back to a project that started around 30 years ago. Developing a re-found interest in using code as a creative tool he has been working on a number of different techniques to develop generative pieces that bridge the digital/physical interface. One side project from this, and almost discovered by accident is <a href="http://musicons.co">Musicons,</a> a project looking at the reproduction of popular album art as favicons.</p>
